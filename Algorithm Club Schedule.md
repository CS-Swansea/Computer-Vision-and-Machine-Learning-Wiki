# The Al-Khwarizmi Algorithm Club

Every month at Algorithm Club, [our postgraduate students](http://csvision.swansea.ac.uk/index.php?n=Site.People#pgr) pick some machine-learning model to study and discuss.

## Potential Items of Discussion

* Any one of these models: https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/The-9-Deep-Learning-Papers-You-Need-To-Know-About.html
* The AlphaFold model that famously predicts protein folding: https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery
* Spatial transformer networks.
