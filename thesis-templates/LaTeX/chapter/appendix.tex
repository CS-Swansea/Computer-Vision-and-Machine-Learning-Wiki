\chapter{Supplementary Data}
\label{app:supplementary_data}

The results of large ablative studies can often take up a lot of space, even with neat visualization and formatting. Consider putting full results in an appendix chapter and showing excerpts of interesting results in your chapters with detailed analysis. You can use labels and references to refer the reader here for the full data.
