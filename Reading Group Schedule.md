# Reading Group Schedule

Every two weeks (normally), our Reading Group, consisting of [our postgraduate students](http://csvision.swansea.ac.uk/index.php?n=Site.People#pgr) discusses of a chapter of the currently assigned book. The two chosen students prepare presentations in advance; each has 15 minutes to present their summary. Thereafter the group discusses the chapter further. Occasionally we produce Jupyter Notebooks from these sessions. 

We are currently reading *Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective* by Stephen Marsland. Our Reading Group is currently split in two: a Junior Group and a Senior Group.
